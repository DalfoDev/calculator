# calculator
The website is a simple calculator application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It offers a user-friendly interface with a responsive design, making it accessible on various devices.

User Interface and Functionality:
The calculator's user interface is visually appealing and well-organized. It consists of a display area at the top where the current input and result are shown. Below the display, there is a grid layout of buttons that represent numbers (0 to 9), decimal points, and various operators (+, -, ×, ÷). The calculator also includes special buttons like "AC" (All Clear) to reset the calculator, "C" to clear the current input, "⌫" (Backspace) to delete the last entered digit, and "+/-" to toggle the sign of the number.

Programming Languages:
The website is built using three primary programming languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

1. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): HTML is used to create the structure and layout of the calculator web page. It defines the various elements, such as buttons, display area, and container divs, which form the building blocks of the calculator.

2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): CSS adds style and design to the calculator interface. It sets the colors, fonts, sizes, and spacing to create an aesthetically pleasing appearance. Additionally, CSS provides the necessary responsiveness to ensure the calculator looks good on different screen sizes.

3. JavaScript: JavaScript is responsible for implementing the calculator's functionality and interactivity. It handles user interactions with the buttons, performs calculations based on the user input, and updates the display to show the results. JavaScript functions are used to manage number inputs, operators, precise actions, backspacing, sign toggling, and calculation.
